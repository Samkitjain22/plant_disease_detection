# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images using TensorFlow and Keras. The model takes images of plant leaves as input and predicts whether the leaf is healthy or infected by a specific disease.
